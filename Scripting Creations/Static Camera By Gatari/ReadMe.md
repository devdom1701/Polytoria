How to use
- In your workspace you will need to place two parts;  wall_1,  camera_1 and camera_2.
- camera_1 is the default camera.
- wall_1 is the first wall
- camera_2 is the second camera.

The script automatically detects the walls and cameras through their name (that's why its important to give them an appropiate name)

When a user touches wall_1 the wall will receive the attribute passed, so that when you go through it again, it will switch the camera to camera_2

Now you can add unlimited walls and cameras
